## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings


18/5/23

So far I have started my neon mask using arcs. This produces curves instead of straight lines unlike my sketch but I'm going to work with it for now while I get the rest of it drawn. My next step is to add the teeth and some eyebrows and alter the dots in the eyes.Â 

24/5/23

Added the halo ellipse. Still havnt added the teeth or other details as I am having a bit of trouble figuring out where to draw them. 

25/5/23

Today Completely redrew the eyes and mouth using new points from the face tracking data. I calculated a range of averages around the eyes and mouth to create new paths for the lines. rather than having a set shape following the eye points I now have dynamic eyes and mouth that change as the face under it does. This works far better and is actually closer to my sketch. I also added pupils and teeth. My next step is to draw some horns and experiment with colour. I also might a new set of eyes that are croses that I can swap too using sliders to increase variation in the final product. 

25/5/23

Changed colour of halo and added sketch files. I also added the cross eye variant and the horns variant but neither are linked to a slider yet. Next step is to do so. 

4/6/23

Everything is now linked to the sliders. I have also added a new mouth varient for open mouths using new values. My next step is to possibly add more colour options and train the sliders.
